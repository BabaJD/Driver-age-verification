# Driver Age Verification

## Description

This Python script determines whether a person is old enough to drive based on their age. It demonstrates the use of:

* **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** It utilizes classes (`Adult` and `Child`) to model different types of individuals and their driving eligibility.
* **Inheritance:** The `Child` class inherits from the `Adult` class, showcasing how to reuse code and create specialized behaviors.
* **Conditional Logic:** An `if-else` statement checks the user's age and creates the appropriate object (either `Adult` or `Child`).
* **User Input:** The script gathers the user's name, age, hair color, and eye color. (Note: Hair and eye color are not used in the current implementation but could be for future enhancements.)

## Potential Improvements

* **Minimum Driving Age:** Make the minimum driving age configurable, as it varies by location.
* **Data Validation:** Add input validation to ensure the user enters a valid age (a positive number).
* **Store Data:** Save user information to a file or database for record-keeping or further analysis.
* **Graphical Interface:** Create a graphical user interface (GUI) for a more user-friendly experience.
